## OTel Metrics

OpenTelemetry is the mechanism by which application code is instrumented, to help make a system observable.

OTel's goal is to provide a set of standardized vendor-agnostic SDKs, APIs, and tools for ingesting, transforming, and sending data to an Observability back-end (i.e. open-source or commercial vendor).

Metrics are aggregations over a period of time of numeric data about your infrastructure or application. Examples include: system error rate, CPU utilization, request rate for a given service.
