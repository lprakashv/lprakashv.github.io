In this post we will try to answer 3 basic question about Backtracking,

1.  What is Backtracking?
2.  How to identify a Backtracking problem?
3.  And, how to approach it?

One of the reason why Backtracking problems are hard to approach and understand is inherent recursion involved. If there are some concepts in programming which sometimes leave your head spinning, “recursion” is definitely one of them.

### What is Backtracking?

It is an algorithmic technique of solving problems which as the name suggests “tracking backwards”. This involves, **_taking a step back_** on **_partial failure_** and then **_taking another direction_**.

### How to Identify Backtracking problems?

### General pattern for solving Backtracking problems
